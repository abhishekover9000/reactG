# React G -

You may have to do a yarn link for this to be globally accessible,
To run in a local folder, simply download the file and then do node reactg [component name][directory] .

Open Source, but if you insist on compensating me for this, buy a sandwich for a local homeless human so both of us can stack some good deeds.
